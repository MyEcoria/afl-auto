# README: Generating Test Files for AFL++

This README explains how to generate test files for AFL++ and what kind of content to include in them, with examples.

## Generating Test Files

1. **Understand the Input Format**:
    - For the `mysh` project, the input format consists of shell commands and arguments. Test files should simulate user inputs to the shell.

2. **Content for Test Files**:
    - Test files should include a variety of shell commands to test the behavior of `mysh`. Below are examples of what to include:

### Examples of Test File Content for `mysh`

#### Valid Inputs
- These are valid shell commands that `mysh` should execute correctly.
    ```text
    ls -l
    ```
    ```text
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```

#### Invalid Inputs
- These are malformed or unsupported commands that `mysh` should handle gracefully.
    ```text
    invalidcommand
    ```
    ```text
    echo "Unclosed string
    ```

#### Boundary Inputs
- These test the limits of `mysh`, such as very long commands or arguments.
    ```text
    echo "a"*1024
    ```
    ```text
    ls -l -a -h -r -t -S -X -U -v -c -u -p -F -G
    ```

#### Edge Cases
- These are unusual inputs that might reveal hidden bugs in `mysh`.
    ```text
    ""
    ```
    ```text
    ;;;;
    ```

3. **Organize Test Files**:
    - Group test files into categories such as `valid`, `invalid`, `boundary`, and `edge_cases` for better clarity.

    Example Directory Structure:
    ```
    tests/
    └── testcases/
         ├── valid/
         │   ├── valid1.txt
         │   └── valid2.txt
         ├── invalid/
         │   ├── invalid1.txt
         │   └── invalid2.txt
         ├── boundary/
         │   ├── boundary1.txt
         │   └── boundary2.txt
         └── edge_cases/
              ├── edge1.txt
              └── edge2.txt
    ```

By including a variety of inputs in your test files, you can ensure comprehensive coverage and improve the effectiveness of your fuzzing efforts with AFL++.
